1. NLP block: Remove punctuation, separate words (tokenize), convert words to primitive form (lemmaztize), convert to lower case (lower) and process input sentences into appropriate data as input for the ANN block.
2. ANN block: Performs prediction of input sentences in topic group and predicts which topic in that group based on probability.
3. Processing and searching block: Process and collect information on the output of the ANN block, using algorithms and databases to get the most appropriate answer.
